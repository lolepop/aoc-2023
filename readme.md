dump of my aoc 2023 solutions. i will probably stop doing these daily since they are tedious and overall not fun to solve

all days have both parts solved but have fragmented parameters/files. very few have been tidied up

most of them were done on my phone (termux and vim) so the formatting for the ts/js projects (code completion is somehow broken) are off
